# Introduction #

PlaceEngine is a GeoLocation technology developed by Sony that uses Wireless Network signals to estimate location.  It is similar to the SkyHook service used by Apple in the iPhone and Mac OS 10.6.  Sony's service is free, and is updated by users themselves.  The PlaceEngine client runs on Windows, Windows Mobile, and Mac OS X at least.  It is also used on several PSP games/applications, and other embedded products.

Unlike CoreLocation, PlaceEngine has a local database, and so can work off-line.
